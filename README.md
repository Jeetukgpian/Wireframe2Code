# AI-Powered Wireframe to Code Converter

## Overview
This project is an AI-driven tool that converts wireframes into **React + Tailwind CSS components**, automating frontend development. It integrates **OpenRouter.ai** for AI-based code generation and **Firebase** for real-time database, authentication, and storage. The system includes a **credit-based AI-powered code editor** that allows users to regenerate and save code efficiently.
